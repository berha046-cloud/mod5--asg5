A simple TCP-based client-server application for transferring text files up to 255 characters.
Features
Server

Listens on port 8080
Accepts filename requests from clients
Validates filenames (prevents path traversal attacks)
Checks file size (max 255 bytes)
Sends file content or appropriate error messages
Handles multiple sequential client connections

Client

Connects to server on localhost
Sends filename as command-line argument
Receives and displays file content or error messages
Clear output formatting

Error Handling
The implementation handles these error conditions:

Invalid filename: Rejects filenames with ".." or "/" to prevent path traversal
File not found: Returns error when file doesn't exist
File size exceeds limit: Checks file size before sending
Connection errors: Handles socket creation, connection, and I/O failures
